## Suggested Workflow

1. **Fill Immediately**: Right after reading the challenge brief, fill in the high-level details here.  
2. **Note Unique Constraints**: If the challenge has special requirements (limited attempts, specific OS, etc.), document them under *Additional Information*.  
3. **List Goals**: Clarify the main flags or tasks so you can keep them in mind during Enumeration and Exploitation.  
4. **Keep it Updated**: If the platform or challenge overview changes (e.g., revised IP), update this document so your final write-up stays accurate.
