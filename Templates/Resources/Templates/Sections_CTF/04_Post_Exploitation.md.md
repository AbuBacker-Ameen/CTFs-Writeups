# Post Exploitation

## Privilege Escalation
- Enumerate local privileges and potential escalation vectors.
- Tools or commands used to discover OS, kernel, or service vulnerabilities.
- The final method used to elevate privileges (e.g., sudo misconfig, kernel exploit, etc.).

## Looting & Lateral Movement
- Files or credentials retrieved (DB configs, SSH keys, password lists).
- Additional hosts or network shares discovered.
- Pivoting steps (SSH pivot, SOCKS proxy, etc.) if relevant.

## Persistence & Cleanup
- Any backdoors or persistent shells set up.
- Steps taken to remove logs or traces if part of the challenge narrative.

## Flags / Proof
- The final user, system, or root flag obtained.
- Where it was located (path) and how you retrieved it.

## Additional Notes
- Any other interesting data or access gained.
- Summarize your post-exploitation success.

## Suggested Workflow

1. **Privilege Escalation**: Right after exploitation, focus on getting higher-level access. Document each step or script used.  
2. **Loot & Lateral**: If the environment is bigger than one machine, detail pivot steps or any further enumeration from the compromised account.  
3. **Persistence**: Some challenges want you to set a backdoor or extra user—add details if relevant.  
4. **Collect Flags**: As soon as you see user or root-level flags, note them, but keep them hidden or hashed if required by challenge rules.  
5. **End on a High Note**: Once you’ve got the final or root flag, you can finalize post-exploitation tasks and transition to writing the Solution.
