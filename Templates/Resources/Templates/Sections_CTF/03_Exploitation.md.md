## Vulnerability Analysis
- Detail the vulnerability or entry point you chose to exploit.
- Reference CVEs, known exploits, or custom scripts you used.

## Exploit Steps
1. **Preparation**  
   - Tools, payloads, or scripts you needed.
   - Any local environment setups (e.g., local exploit modifications).
2. **Execution**  
   - Command lines, code snippets, or scripts run against the target.
   - Screenshots or logs showing success/failure.
3. **Results**  
   - Shell obtained? Which user? Any confirmation of access?

## Alternative Exploits (if applicable)
- Note any other vectors you tested or explored but maybe didnâ€™t fully develop.

## Evidence / Screenshots
- Insert relevant screenshots demonstrating the exploit in action.

## Lessons Learned
- Any key takeaways regarding the exploit technique or process.

## Suggested Workflow

1. **Map Findings to Exploits**: Based on Enumeration, decide which vulnerability or version to target first.  
2. **Document Step-by-Step**: Keep a running log of every command and script, so you can replicate later or show proof.  
3. **Include Proof**: Snap screenshots or logs demonstrating success (shell access, captured flags).  
4. **Consider Alternate Paths**: If you discover multiple vulnerabilities, briefly explore or mention them.  
5. **Stay Organized**: Maintain a neat bullet/numbering system so others (or you in the future) can follow your exploitation logic easily.
