## Suggested Workflow

1. **Write After Finishing**: Reflect on the entire process once the challenge is complete.  
2. **Do a Quick Recap**: Summarize the main steps so future readers can see the big picture without diving into each detail.  
3. **Highlight Learning Points**: Note the unique skills or techniques you gained.  
4. **Add References**: If certain blog posts, CVEs, or tools were essential, list them here so you can revisit them in future challenges.  
5. **Archive / Share**: This final doc can be shared with teammates or used as personal notes for future CTFs.
